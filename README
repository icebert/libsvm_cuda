Extended libSVM with parallelized cross-validation


When performing corss-validation (CV), this tool will utilize mutli-cores
to speed up the CV process. It utilizes the same number of threads as the
fold of CV (For 10 fold corss-validation, it will use 10 threads).

The multiple threads implementation is based on OpenMP.



Libsvm is a simple, easy-to-use, and efficient software for SVM
classification and regression. It solves C-SVM classification, nu-SVM
classification, one-class-SVM, epsilon-SVM regression, and nu-SVM
regression. It also provides an automatic model selection tool for
C-SVM classification. This document explains the use of libsvm.
