GPU accelerated libSVM grid search

This tool implements grid search of SVM parameters (cost and gamma),
based on NVIDIA CUDA framework, in svm-train. It takes advantages of
GPU parallel computing and support model level parallelization.

To run this tool, the CUDA toolkit and runtime environment should be
properly installed. This tool requires a minimum of 4GB GPU memory.



Libsvm is a simple, easy-to-use, and efficient software for SVM
classification and regression. It solves C-SVM classification, nu-SVM
classification, one-class-SVM, epsilon-SVM regression, and nu-SVM
regression. It also provides an automatic model selection tool for
C-SVM classification. This document explains the use of libsvm.
